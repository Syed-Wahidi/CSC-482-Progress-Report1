Our project is about making a resource management tool that can be accessed through any OS. The resource managment tool will help anyone
create a place to put their files and have easy access to them. One example is a teacher using it to store materials for a course.

My particular role is to research different ways of creating a resource management tool, and testing the website.

I have researched different ways we can implement the resource management tool, first I created a moodle cloud site for testing purposes.
Second I have researched wordpress and IGOOGLE portal to create the resource management tool.

So far our team has created a website which can be used as a resource management tool.
